  Johnny Mohawk is the digital alter ego of John Nelson-Alden, born in the early days of quarantine. While John Nelson-Alden was
  busy dealing with the realities of the changing world being shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the toll it was taking on his
  business, Johnny Mohawk was learning to code. While John Nelson-Alden was cripppled by grief of the unexpected death of his
  father, Johnny Mohawk took the wheel.

  I know this sounds crazy.. It was crazy. I just didn’t know how to be myself at the time, and to be honest I really didn’t
  know who John Nelson-Alden was anymore. Johnny Mohawk became an avenue to entirely reinvent myself. In hindsight the creation
  of this persona was an introspective exercise the likes of which only occur in times of crisis. Thankfully, this exercise has
  been a very fruitful one, and now in 2022, I have begun a new chapter of my career as a software engineer and refocused my
  work and non-work life around the arts. 

  Today, Johnny Mohawk is now a personal brand. Johnny Mohawk represents drive, reinvention, innovation, passion and engaging
  design. 

  Now that you know about Johnny Mohawk… the question becomes, who the f*ck is John Nelson-Alden?
  
  Let’s start here.

  ### John Nelson-Alden: I was never young.

  Yep, that's me. This was the beginning of my professional career. The year was 1991. The character was Nicholas Newman. The show was The Young and the Restless... and I was never young.
